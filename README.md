# Taiwan-Credit-Card-Default

This is a machine learning implementation in order to analyze and predict a default from Taiwan Credit Card Default dataset.
The dataset is from UCI Machine Learning repository.
I created this to fulfill Final Assignment for Machine Learning course in National Taiwan Normal University. 

Goals:
1. To predict a default on the next credit card payment using SVM.
2. Cluster the customer into k groups using kMeans clustering.
